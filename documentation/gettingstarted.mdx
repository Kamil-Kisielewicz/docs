## Install
You can install Trellis with any of the following methods:

### Pip
```
pip install trellis_dag
```

### Poetry
```
poetry add trellis_dag
```

### Conda
```
conda install trellis_dag
```

**TODO: This will probably need to change since we're using poetry.**

## Set environment variables
If you’re using our built-in LLM tool, you’ll need to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable; either in a .env file or with the following command:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Tutorial Overview

The next step in our tutorial is preparing our `LLM` calls. Trellis comes with a pre-built LLM tool which already handles rate limits and errors, so we'll be using that. 
Trellis currently only supports OpenAI, so if you want to use a different model you'll have to extend `Node` and write your own tool for it.

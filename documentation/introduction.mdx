**Trellis is an [open-source](https://github.com/interlocklabs/exp-4.1.0-trellis) framework for programmatically
orchestrating LLM workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Python.** We've intentionally designed it to give 
developers as much control as possible, and we've written extensive documentation to make it incredibly easy to 
get started.

Trellis is composed of only three abstractions: `Node`, `DAG`, and `LLM`.
- Node: the fundamental unit of computation in Trellis. Nodes are chained together to form a DAG. 
  You can extend `Node` and modify its `execute` function, input schema, and output schema to implement any business logic.
- DAG: a directed acyclic graph of `Node`s. It is the primary abstraction for orchestrating LLM workflows. When you 
  add edges between `Node`s, you can specify a transformation function to reuse `Node`s and connect any two `Node`s.
  Trellis verifies the data flowing between `Nodes` in a `DAG` to ensure that the workflow is valid. 
- LLM: a wrapper around a large language model which handles exceptions and rate limiting for you. Currently, the only provider
  that Trellis supports is OpenAI.
